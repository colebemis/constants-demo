# iFixit Style Constants

This site documents the style `constants` made available by [Toolbox](https://github.com/iFixit/toolbox/tree/master/src/constants). We use style constants in place of hard-coded values (such as hex values for color, or pixel values for spacing) in order to maintain a scalable and consistent visual system for UI development.
